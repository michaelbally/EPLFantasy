<h1>📊 Gameweek 6</h1>

<h2>📰 Team Headlines</h2>
<h3>🎸 Simon Edwards - Chuna believe it</h3>
<img height="300" alt="manager-simon1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c73b224e-8e13-495a-affd-576c05971041" />

    <p>Simon didn’t just win the week — he detonated it. A colossal 92 points catapulted him from mid-table chaos merchant to league leader overnight. One rival was overheard muttering, “It’s like watching David Brent conduct an orchestra.” But this sitcom episode came with a heavy-metal soundtrack — Iron Maiden blaring, bass riffs shaking, and Edwards proudly posting a “#LinkedInLeader” update to rub it in.

In his post-match press conference, Edwards couldn’t resist throwing shade: “Some managers talk about moats, others about BBQs… I just play the game properly.” Reports suggest his squad celebrated by bidding for each other on eBay, with the goalkeeper fetching £12 and a used bass pedal.</p>

<h3>🔥 Daniel Dring - Burn Baby Burn</h3>
<img width="300" alt="manager-dring2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ccc8be2b-77aa-4550-b80a-56b20acc1a28" />
<p>GW points: 42<br>
    avg GW points: 51.2<br>

    transfers in: Kudus, Semenyo<br>
    transfers out: Tavernier, Wirtz</p>
    <p>Dring’s disco lights flickered this week, with a modest 42 points cooling his inferno. But despite the stumble, he’s still breathing down Edwards’ neck. Toon Army chants of “Geordie disco, burning bright!” filled St. James’ Park, while a source claims Dring spent the weekend angrily explaining expected goals to a confused post office clerk.

When asked about Edwards’ surge, Dring barked: “He’s a one-week wonder. I’ve been burning since August, and this fire doesn’t go out.” Rumours swirl of him threatening to install pyrotechnics on the touchline just to intimidate Kane’s crumbling fortress.</p>

<h3>🤘 John Stanley - Flying High Again</h3>
<img height="300" alt="manager-stanley1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a294cd6-4939-4dd8-93ea-5764d6366aa8" />

    <p>Another week, another power chord. Stanley hit 69 and stayed locked in third, keeping his rock ’n’ roll march alive. Word from the dressing room is that half his squad is running on Red Bull and feedback loops, with baby monitors blaring through the amps. One exhausted midfielder confessed, “We train at 3am because that’s when the baby’s awake.”

In true Ozzy fashion, Stanley quipped post-match: “I might be knackered, but I can still outscore half these jokers.” The league is split: some admire the resilience, others claim he’s one broken guitar string away from collapse.</p>

<h3>🏰 Jonathan Kane - Real Moat</h3>
<img height="300" alt="manager-jonny3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb9c5f0b-2d68-4de7-b2e4-9f56f291ff29" />

    transfers in: Vicario<br>
    transfers out: Sánchez</p>
    <p>Once the lord of the league, Kane’s moat is leaking badly. Another slip saw him fall to 4th, and whispers from Dubai suggest his students are sick of medieval siege analogies. One insider leaked his chalkboard notes: “Homework: How to stop Desmond breaching the drawbridge.”

Kane struck a defiant tone: “Castles don’t fall in a week. Edwards can enjoy his little sitcom moment — winter is coming.” Yet rivals are circling, with Dring openly mocking: “His moat’s a puddle. I’ll dance right through it.” The siege is well and truly on.</p>

<h3>💀 Michael Desmond - Cunha Get Any Worse</h3>
<img height="300" alt="manager-dez1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1820eb06-dcd9-4fbf-a43b-857dba782719" />
<p>GW points: 71<br>
    avg GW points: 51.3<br>
    standings change: +1<br>
    avg rank: 4.7<br>
    chips used: -<br>
    transfers in: Gravenberch, Pedro<br>
    transfers out: Ekitiké, Johnson</p>
    <p>The silent assassin crept forward again, this time with a slick 71. Desmond doesn’t roar — he stalks. Reports claim he spent the weekend walking his dogs while blasting vinyl shark documentaries in the background. Rivals laughed it off, but the table shows he’s only four points off Kane’s throne.

Pressed for comment, Desmond simply smiled and muttered: “Sharks don’t talk. They bite.” Jonathan Kane reportedly asked for extra moat reinforcements that same evening.</p>

<h3>🍖 Joel Xavier - K-BBQ FC</h3>
<img height="300" alt="manager-joel3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93e04e86-32d0-4fc4-94ca-33ceb0144f94" />
<p>GW points: 56<br>
    avg GW points: 51.5<br>
    standings change: -2<br>
    avg rank: 5.2<br>
    chips used: wildcard<br>
    transfers in: Zubimendi<br>
    transfers out: Ødegaard</p>
    <p>Joel’s BBQ smoked decently with 56, but the pitmaster dropped two places. Sources say he spent more time flipping meat than setting lineups, as his players looked half-cooked by Sunday. His rivals mock him as the “mad chef” — brilliant one week, over-seasoned the next.

At the presser, Joel hit back: “Better overcooked than underprepared. Edwards’ 92 was luck, Dring’s fire is fizzling, and I’m just getting started.” Rumour has it he’s already got spreadsheets of marinades ready for GW7.</p>

<h3>💸 Michael Ball - Budget Ballers</h3>
<img width="300" alt="manager-me" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af91e5b9-0cce-4ae8-bb22-33c45ed31997" />

    chips used: wildcard<br>
    transfers in: -<br>
    transfers out: -</p>
<p>Another week, another scrape from the bargain bin. Ball pulled 49, but remains marooned at the bottom. Insiders spotted him outside Aldi trying to swap two knock-off defenders for a single striker, muttering about “multi-buy deals.” Rivals jeer, but Ball remains defiant.

In his weekly press note, he snapped: “If I had their budgets, I’d be top. Instead, I’m making magic with duct tape and 3-for-1 coupons.”</p>
