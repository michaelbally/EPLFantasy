<h1>📊 Gameweek 4 Report</h1>

<h2>🔄 Transfer Watch</h2>
<ul>Michael Ball: Swapped out Wissa for Evanilson. A direct forward replacement — clearly seeking a more reliable source of goals.</ul>
<ul>Michael Desmond: Two players out (Cunha, Aina) and two in (Livramento, Mbeumo). Strengthened both defence and attack, suggesting a push for more balance.</ul>
<ul>Daniel Dring: Made defensive and midfield changes, moving out Cherki and Gvardiol for Calafiori and Tavernier. Looks like a bid for more stability at the back and creativity going forward.</ul>
<ul>John Stanley: No transfers this week. Kept faith with his existing squad.</ul>
<ul>Jonathan Kane: Simple one-for-one move — Cherki out, Rice in. Adds solidity to the midfield.</ul>
<ul>Simon Edwards: No transfers made. Standing firm for now.</ul>
<ul>Joel Xavier: The busiest in the market. Four players out (Cunha, Nouri, Acheampong, Saka) and four in (Chalobah, Grealish, Timber, Odegaard). A major reshuffle signalling dissatisfaction with recent performances.</ul>

<h2>📰 Manager Headlines</h2>
<ul>🏰 Jonathan Kane (Real Moat, 53 pts, 1st – 233 total)</ul>
<ul>The king still sits atop his castle, but whispers say the moat is showing cracks. Kane scored 53 and kept his crown, but rivals are circling. Reporters grilled him about his Dubai “scouting trip,” and he snapped: “It’s called networking — not a holiday!” One rival manager joked: “If he’s not careful, we’ll storm that drawbridge with inflatable flamingos.” Kane smirked and left the presser early, sunglasses on indoors. 🏝️🛡️😎</ul>
<ul>🔥 Daniel Dring (Burn Baby Burn, 61 pts, 2nd – 225 total)</ul>
<ul>Dring’s Toon-fuelled army racked up 61 points, and he’s not hiding the fight. On the touchline he was caught yelling: “Kane’s castle is cardboard!” before booting a water bottle into the stands. He accused referees of “southern bias” and refused to shake hands post-match. When asked if he respected Kane’s lead, Dring snarled: “Respect? He’s building sandcastles while I’m torching fortresses.” The Geordie war drums are banging louder than ever. ⚫⚪🔥🥁</ul>
<ul>✈️ John Stanley (Flying High Again, 69 pts, 3rd – 201 total)</ul>
<ul>Stanley hit a league-best 69 points and swaggered into the press room waving a baby bottle. “Sleep deprivation makes you dangerous,” he declared, before pointing at Desmond’s seat: “That’s what collapse looks like.” His players reportedly formed a guard of honour for his buggy at training. Rival managers rolled their eyes, but the chant of the week came from his dressing room: “Cry, feed, win, repeat!” 👶✈️💪</ul>
<ul>🤯 Simon Edwards (Chuna believe it, 55 pts, 4th – 178 total)</ul>
<ul>What a comeback — Edwards stormed from 7th to 4th with 55 points and chaos followed. At his presser he arrived dripping wet, blaming sprinklers triggered during “celebratory fireworks.” He pointed fingers at Ball and Desmond: “You laughed when I was bottom — Chuna believe it now?” Security had to separate him from reporters after he accused one of being on Kane’s payroll. Rival managers say he’s unhinged — and loving it. 🚿🔥📈</ul>
<ul>🍖 Joel Xavier (K-BBQ FC, 59 pts, 5th – 177 total)</ul>
<ul>The tinkerer struck again, pulling in 59 points, but his squad looked smoked out. Reports claim half the team refused to attend yet another “morale-boosting BBQ.” Joel defended himself: “Tinkering wins trophies — don’t like the smoke? Get off my grill!” He then jabbed at Edwards: “At least I don’t need sprinklers to cool me down.” Players muttered he’s one kebab skewer away from a meltdown. 🍗🔥😤</ul>
<ul>💀 Michael Desmond (Cunha Get Any Worse, 42 pts, 6th – 173 total)</ul>
<ul>A brutal week — just 42 points and a three-place plummet. Desmond erupted post-match, slamming his fist on the table and shouting: “I don’t collapse, I regroup!” before storming off. Dressing-room leaks suggest senior players staged a mutiny over his constant league-table lectures. One insider quipped: “He’s less a manager, more a motivational speaker — and not a good one.” Rivals gleefully piled on, chanting: “Cunha get any worse?” 📉💥🙈</ul>
<ul>💸 Michael Ball (Budget Ballers, 43 pts, 7th – 167 total)</ul>
<ul>Ball’s thrifty squad managed 43 points, but he remains bottom. Asked about spending, he snapped: “I don’t waste money like the rest of them.” Players allegedly trained with cones made of upturned milk bottles, and one was spotted wearing mismatched boots. Rivals mocked: “He’s running a car boot sale, not a football club.” Ball stormed out of his interview after being asked if he’s the “Aldi Ancelotti.” 💷🥾🛒</ul>
